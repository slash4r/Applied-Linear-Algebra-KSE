# 2D Shape Transformations

🚀 This project demonstrates various linear transformations on 2D shapes using Python's NumPy and Matplotlib libraries. The shapes included are a "Batman" logo and a star. The transformations include rotation, scaling, reflection, shearing, and custom transformations.

## Getting Started

🔧 **Prerequisites**

- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (for the second part of the assignment)

## Running the Code

1. Save the code in a Python file, e.g., `transformations.py`.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed.
3. Run the script using Python IDE such as VSCode or Jupyter Notebook, or from the terminal using the command below

```bash
python transformations.py
```

## Features

✨ **Shapes**

- **Batman Logo**
- **Star**
- **Custom Images** (for the second part of the assignment)

✨ **Transformations**

- Rotation
- Scaling
- Reflection
- Shearing
- Custom transformations

## Usage

🎮 **Key Bindings**

- **Right Arrow**: Next transformation
- **Left Arrow**: Previous transformation
- **A**: Next original shape
- **D**: Previous original shape
- **Z**: Next transformation and original shape (Right Arrow + A)
- **X**: Previous transformation and original shape (Left Arrow + D)

The plot will update to show the original shape and the transformed shape side by side.
